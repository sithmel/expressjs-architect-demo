Expressjs Architect Demo
========================

A demo of a modular express.js application using architect.

[Architect](https://github.com/c9/architect) allows to split your application in modules and put modules together at run time.
Each single module is a valid NPM module (you have to install it using npm install).
The "bootstrap" module is under the main folder.
"exp" is the module containing the express application definition.
"app1" is an example of a addable component: a simple view. 

How to run
----------
Run "npm install" under main, exp and app1. Run the application using node app.js under "main".
